# Fool's Compass

Fool's Compass is a quirky web app that offers mood-based advice for those moments when you just need something random, ridiculous, or surprisingly insightful to brighten your day.

## Inspiration
As my first hackathon project, I wanted to dive into something fun, lighthearted, and creative. Fool's Compass is the result of brainstorming ways to blend humor with a simple web app. The goal? To create an interactive experience that brings a smile (or confusion) to users.

## Features
- Pick your mood from options like "Just Vibing in Ohio" or "Existential Crisis."
- Get hilariously random advice tailored to your mood.
- A clean, colorful interface with fun animations for a lively experience.

## Built With
- **Flask**: For backend routing and serving dynamic advice.
- **HTML/CSS**: To design and style the app's interface.
- **JavaScript**: For user interactions and fetching advice dynamically.
- **Vercel**: To deploy and host the project seamlessly.

## Challenges
Deploying the app was a learning curve, especially dealing with dependencies and Flask integration. Styling the app to look consistent across screen sizes also required troubleshooting and experimenting with flexbox.

## Accomplishments
- Building and deploying my first web app in a hackathon environment.
- Learning how to integrate Flask with a responsive front-end design.
- Creating an experience that's as much about fun as it is about learning.

## What I Learned
- **Flask Basics**: How to set up routes and handle dynamic content.
- **HTML/CSS**: Creating a responsive, visually appealing interface with animations.
- **JavaScript**: Managing user interactions and dynamic data fetching.
- **Deployment**: Understanding Vercel and fixing common deployment issues.
